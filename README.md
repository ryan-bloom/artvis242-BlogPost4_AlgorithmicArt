This piece of art is really interesting to me becuase it its use of audio and visuals.  Users are expected to sing, and their vocals are then run through a certain software that distorts them and creates these beautiful images to express the users' voices. I find this to be an extremely interesting and unique way to have a user interract with a work of art. What drew me to this work was the way in which users are expected to interact with the work as well as the wide variety of visual outcomes that are produced by the work.  For example, one can see in the images above that the visualizations of users' voices range from black and white shapes to vibrant and glowing colors.  The use of software to analyze, manipulate, and create these beautiful pieces is fascinating to me.

This artwork is vastly different from the algorithmic pieces that we observed in class as well as the first piece that I analyzed in this blog.  This work is far less technical and digital, and far closer to classic works of art such as paintings and drawings.  I the fact that this piece combined the use of algorithms as well as the more classic forms of art is what drew me to this piece, as I have always been more of a classical artist/drawer myself.  Although this piece does resembel more classic works due to the fact that it is physically apply some material to a canvas, the materials used (in this case, gun powder, thermochromatic pigment, and beet-dyed pigment), as well as the way in which the materials were applied to said canvas are extremely unique.  Addie manages to bring this piece into the modern era by applying these materials using drone aircrafts to spread them across the canvas.  It is through these aircrafts that various algorithms are applied (such as the algorithm that makes the drone land, take off, and barrel roll) to this work, putting a new spin on algorithmic art when compared to some of the virutally generated works that we saw in class.  Finally, users do not fully interract with these works, but some of the materials used, such as thermochromatic pigment, are heat sensative and change in color with changing environment.  Therefore, one work is never the same due to environmental changes, and users can alter pieces by tampering with its surroundings.
